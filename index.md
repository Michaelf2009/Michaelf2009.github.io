### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    I really liked this lab because it felt like something that could actually
    exist in a real city app. The different parking rules made the logic more
    interesting, and I enjoyed breaking each sign down into specific conditions.
    It also helped me get more comfortable reading and translating real-world
    instructions into boolean expressions. Even though the rules were kind of
    confusing at first, it felt satisfying once everything finally worked and
    passed the tests. This lab helped me realize how important input validation
    is and how to structure a program so it doesnt crash when the user types
    something wrong. I also learned how to combine multiple logical rules using
    && and || the right way. The exercise reinforced how useful functions can be
    when organizing code, because each street had its own rule set, and separating
    them made the program easier to debug and understand.

* Lab 3

    I liked this lab because it finally made a big formula feel manageable.
    At first the Fliegel & Van Flandern algorithm looked overwhelming,
    but breaking it into smaller pieces and testing each part made it feel
    doable. I also liked that the program used real dates that we could recognize,
    like birthdays or historical years, so the calculation didnt feel abstract.
    The debugging steps (compile, runtime, logic) were helpful too, because they
    gave the lab a clear workflow instead of just guessing what went wrong. It
    felt good seeing the test cases pass once everything lined up. This lab helped
    me understand how powerful functions can be when solving a larger problem.
    JulianDay, DateDifference, and PrintDate each handled their own job, and
    having to keep the prototypes the same taught me how important function
    interfaces are. I also learned how to work with integer-only calculations
    and how careful you have to be with parentheses when translating a mathematical
    formula into C++ code. Running make test and comparing my results to the expected
    outputs showed me how to systematically fix logic errors. Overall, this lab
    strengthened my understanding of writing functions, debugging, and translating
    real-world formulas into working code

* Lab 9

    I liked this lab because it finally tied together vectors, file handling, and
    functions in a way that felt like a real program instead of just small examples.
    It was interesting how reading words from a dictionary file and comparing them
    to a document created a simple version of something we see every day in apps.
    I also liked that the program had multiple files (spelling.cc and spelling_functions.cc),
    because it showed how bigger projects are organized. Debugging the misspelled
    words output was actually satisfying once everything lined up with the test
    cases. This lab helped me understand how to use vectors more effectively,
    especially when passing them between functions. I learned how important
    it is to break a problem into smaller parts, like separating ReadWords,
    InDictionary, and MisspelledWords. It also reinforced how to handle file
    input correctly and check for errors when a file cant be opened. Using
    make test and reading the differences between expected and actual output
    taught me how to fix logic errors in a systematic way. Overall, the lab
    improved my skills with file I/O, function design, and debugging
    multi-file programs.
